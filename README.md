## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### What I learned

My first Next.js project, built entirely on my own. What I'm most proud of is how comfortable I've become with Next.js!

### Continued development

I attempted to integrate parallax effects and smooth scrolling using Framer Motion but faced significant challenges. Moving forward, I plan to deepen my understanding of animation techniques to refine my skills before applying for jobs. Additionally, I aim to strengthen my grasp of Next.js alongside my MERN stack, as it significantly enhances SEO, performance, and developer experience.
